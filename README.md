# Daily-Journal v1
A Simple blog-type website. Also, my introduction to express and the EJS template engine.

This project is a simple blog/news site built without a database. *(ie: In its current state, information submitted will not be saved permanently.)*

The intent to build this site is to understand the express server, further expand on JavaScript syntax, practice CSS styling, and provide myself an introduction to the EJS template engine.
